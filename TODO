* Fix APPEARANCE of occasional gui "hang" when using dynamic album art:
Problem is more common in Windows, but sometimes happens in Linux.
Workaround is to pop up and pop back down the "About Fauxdacious" screen.
I have tried numerous things and spent copious amounts of labor to fix this
but have been unable to so far...

* Package all this into four separate Debian packages (source and binary for
both Fauxdacious and Fauxdacious Plugins.

* (Qt): Make Effects plugin screen (checkboxes) update when song change (with
custom equalizer and effects settings) changes the active effects plugins.
The effect plugins get properly turned off and on, but the QT screen does NOT
update the checkboxes unless you click on the screen.  So far I have not
found a way to fix this annoyance.

* Remove Adplug Classic plugin when Debian FINALLY gets around to patching
or upgrading Adplug.  But may just leave in anyway! :)
