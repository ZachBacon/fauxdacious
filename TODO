Rebuild v3.9 on Windows (after installing the new dependencies and patches 
required by Audacious v3.9*, then clean up the Windows build-notes accordingly.

Package all this into four separate Debian packages (source and binary for 
both Fauxdacious and Fauxdacious Plugins.

Fix stupid but harmless DBus errors when exiting the QT version.  I've tried 
everything I can think of for now though.

Add an Equalizer Preset window for the QT version (when Audacious finally 
gets around to doing this, since I know NOTHING about QT programming and 
they've told everyone NOT to bug 'em about it until they get to it) so I 
can add our custom Equalizer Preset features to our QT users!

Remove Adplug Classic plugin when Debian FINALLY gets around to patching 
or upgrading Adplug.
