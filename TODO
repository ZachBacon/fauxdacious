Rebuild v3.10 on Windows (after installing the new dependencies and patches 
required by Audacious v3.9*, then clean up the Windows build-notes accordingly.

Package all this into four separate Debian packages (source and binary for 
both Fauxdacious and Fauxdacious Plugins.

Fix stupid but harmless DBus errors when exiting the QT version.  I've tried 
everything I can think of for now though.

Make Effects plugin screen (checkboxes) update when song change (with custom 
equalizer and effects settings) changes the active effects plugins.  The 
effect plugins get properly turned off and on, but the QT screen does NOT 
update the checkboxes unless you click on the screen.  So far I have not 
found a way to fix this annoyance.

Remove Adplug Classic plugin when Debian FINALLY gets around to patching 
or upgrading Adplug.
