NOTE:  You must first uninstall all audacious packages, including libfauxdcore, 
libfauxdgui*, libfauxdtag*, etc.  IF you wish to keep BOTH your existing Audacious 
installed AND install Fauxdacious (assuming it's in /usr/bin/), you must 
first do:

(Change "/usr/local" everywhere below to where you want to install Fauxdacious):
$ export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib   <=== NEEDED WHENEVER RUNNING (/usr/local/bin/fauxdacious)!
$ export PKG_CONFIG_PATH=/usr/local/lib/pkgconfig
$ export CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include
$ export C_INCLUDE_PATH=/usr/local/include


If running a current 64-bit Debian stable installation or equivalent, you can 
try simply running:

	make install

after untarring the tarballs, as the objects (compiled for that system) are 
already built and included.  If not, you'll need to build from scratch:

from:  http://redmine.audacious-media-player.org/boards/1/topics/788?r=1762#message-1762

Dependencies:

sudo apt-get install git automake build-essential libasound2-dev \
libavformat-dev libbinio-dev libbs2b-dev libcddb2-dev libcdio-cdda-dev \
libcue-dev libcurl4-gnutls-dev libdbus-glib-1-dev libfaad-dev libflac-dev \
libfluidsynth-dev libgl1-mesa-dev-lts-utopic libgtk2.0-dev libguess-dev \
libjack-jackd2-dev liblircclient-dev libmms-dev libmodplug-dev libmp3lame-dev \
libmpg123-dev libneon27-gnutls-dev libnotify-dev libpulse-dev \
libsamplerate0-dev libsdl2-dev libsidplayfp-dev libsndfile1-dev libsoxr-dev \
libvorbis-dev libwavpack-dev libxml2-dev

After installing any missing from the above list of dependencies, if you 
untarred the tarballs, THEN:

	cd fauxdacious-plugins
	sudo make distclean
	cd ../fauxdacious
	sudo make distclean

OTHERWISE (download and install from Github):

	cd /tmp
	mkdir fauxdacious
	mkdir fauxdacious-plugins
	git clone git://github.com/wildstar84/fauxdacious.git fauxdacious
	git clone git://github.com/wildstar84/fauxdacious-plugins.git audacious-plugins

NOW, regardless of whether installing from the tarballs OR from Github:

	cd fauxdacious
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local [--enable-qt] --with-buildstamp=Fauxdacious
	make
	sudo make install
	cd ../fauxdacious-plugins
	./autogen.sh
	./configure --prefix=/usr/local [--enable-qt]
	make
	sudo make install
	cd /usr/local/bin
	sudo ln -s audacious fauxdacious
	sudo update-desktop-database
	sudo update-icon-caches /usr/share/icons/hicolor

Now run fauxdacious:

	fauxdacious -Dc &

Fauxdacious should now start up with an empty playlist.  Enjoy!
